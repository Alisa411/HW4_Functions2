# Das biotools.aminoacids
> **The great and terrifying successor of biopython**

Das biotools strikes again! Now it works only with aminoacid sequences! 

## Features

- **calculate_pI**: Calculate the isoelectric point of a given amino acid sequence, both individually for each amino acid and for the entire sequence.

- **build_scoring_matrix**: Build a scoring matrix for amino acid pairs, which can be used in sequence alignment algorithms.

- **needleman_wunsch**: Implement the Needleman-Wunsch algorithm for global sequence alignment of two amino acid sequences.
